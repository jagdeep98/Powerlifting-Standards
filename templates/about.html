        <h1>About Powerlifting Standards</h1>
        <p>These standards are relative to 172,398 lifters from 
            <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/" target="_blank">openpowerlifting.org</a>, 
            specifically those who competed and achieved a total in raw (with sleeves) full power IPF-affiliated meets (with repeat name entries removed).

        <h2>Strength Categories</h2>
        <p><strong>Beginner (Stronger than less than 20% of lifters)</strong><br>
        A lifter with at least a six months of training. They can perform the main lifts with proper form but are still developing strength.</p>

        <p><strong>Novice (Stronger than 20% of lifters)</strong><br>
        A lifter with about one year of training. They have solid technique and are stronger than most beginner lifters, making steady progress.</p>

        <p><strong>Intermediate (Stronger than 50% of lifters)</strong><br>
        A lifter with at least two years of consistent training. They have developed good technique and strength, but progress slows and requires advanced planning.</p>

        <p><strong>Advanced (Stronger than 80% of lifters)</strong><br>
        A lifter with over five years of experience. They are highly skilled and strong, but further progress requires very specialised training and recovery.</p>

        <p><strong>Elite (Stronger than 95% of lifters)</strong><br>
        A lifter who has trained for years and competes at a top level. Their strength and technique are among the best, often competing nationally or internationally.</p>
